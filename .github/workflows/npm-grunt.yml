The error `Error: Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/Portfolio/Portfolio` indicates that the GitHub Actions workflow is unable to find a lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, or `yarn.lock`) in the specified working directory. This is likely because:

1. **No Lock File Present**: A lock file wasn’t generated or committed to your repository.
2. **Working Directory Mismatch**: The `working-directory` in your workflow might not align with where your project files (including the lock file) are located.
3. **Cache Issue**: The `npm install` step might not be creating the lock file due to a misconfiguration or missing initial setup.

### Fix
To resolve this, ensure a lock file is present and correctly referenced in your workflow. Here’s how to update your GitHub Actions workflow:

#### Updated Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: main

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Verify working directory
        run: ls -la
        working-directory: portfolio

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: portfolio

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: portfolio
        env:
          REACT_APP_SERVICE_ID: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_SERVICE_ID }}
          REACT_APP_TEMPLATE_ID: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_TEMPLATE_ID }}
          REACT_APP_PUBLIC_KEY: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_PUBLIC_KEY }}

      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages
          FOLDER: portfolio/dist
